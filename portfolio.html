			<h2>Blender projects</h2>
			<h4>Mesh model – Big Daddy from Bioshock</h4>
			<P>The first assignment for my 3d fundamental animation class in Fall 2022 was to create a mesh model in blender. Using a blueprint for a selected object from a piece of media as a reference to recreate it in blender. I selected a Big Daddy from the first Bioshock video game and found the blueprint online. I used the mirror modifier to create the right side of the model’s head, torse, and legs. Then I modeled the drill and his left hand separately.</P>

			<h1>Adobe InDesign</h1>
			<p>Below are the assignments I have created for the adobe InDesign course I took in spring of 2023. We did not do all 16 lessons in the 2020 version of Adobe InDesign, ‘classroom in a book’, because It was only a half of a semester.  The lessons we covered had us working with the major parts of the software to use it effectively. I used these techniques to create a postcard, calendar, brochure, and restaurant menu.</p>
			<h2>Postcard</h2>
			<p>The first assignment for my InDesign class was to make a postcard invitation for an event. I used guides, item frames, and the text tool for the back and left side of the front. I used the line segment tool to created the address lines.</p>
			<div class="container-fluid">

					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h2>Calendar</h2>
			<p>For the calendar assignment I used the master page to create the table, month text box, frame at the top. Then edited the individual pages with a different image of my or family pets and put the correct numbers for each month in place for 2024. I also edited the images in photoshop to make the quality better and crop it to fit the item frame nicely.</p>

			<h2>Brochure</h2>
			<p>I made the brochure an informational pamphlet about the mineral quartz, something you would see in a science museum. It’s target audience is children, and is hopefully something to peak there interest in rocks. The images are royalty free from Pixabay.</p>

			<h2>Menu</h2>
			<p>The assignment was to redesign the menu from a restaurant we liked. I choose to redesign the dessert menu from Truffles and Tortes, a French style café located in Anoka, Minnesota. I copied their menu from their website into a word document. I deleted the bullet points and changed the order of a few of the items around to fit in the columns better. I used columns to align the items across the two pages. Character and paragraph styles to make the paragraphs, titles, and headings unified. The dessert image on the front of the menu is edited but the original is royalty free from Pixabay. The corner mandala was created by me in Illustrator a few years ago and cropped down from the original. I used warped text to make the name curved.</p>

			<h1>Adobe Illustrator</h1>
			<p>Below are my creative projects from my Adobe Illustrator college course. In the class I learned the software through the 16 lessons from the 2020 version of Adobe Illustrator,'classroom in a book'. I used the techniques from thoughs lesson to create coasters, halloween and event posters, and a business card.</p>
			
			<h2>Coasters</h2>
			<p>In the left image is my coaster design the first project for the class. I did the four seasons from the perspective of my grandmas and her home. I am always at peace when visting her and love doing so during different times of the year.</p>
			<div class="container-fluid">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<img class="coaster img-fluid" src="images/coaster.png" alt="four circles with images inside representing the four seasons" height="613" width="762" >
					</div>

					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<img class="card img-fluid" src="images/business-card.jpg" alt="rectangular grid of ten sections in two columes with words and a ghostly girl image on a dark blue background" height="612" width="792" >
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
				<h2>Business Card</h2>
				<p> The business card logo was the final project for the class. I had the image of a long haired cat girl with her hair blowing in the wind over her face. It turned into a ghostly image, which I quite like. I made the image almost completly with the pen tool, using the ellipse tool to make the eyes and basic head shape.</p>
				
				<h2>Halloween project</h2>
				<p>For the halloween project we needed to make a poster for halloween or fall themed event. I made a poster for the ghost tour that is offerd in Anoka, Minnesoda. The ghost tour is a real event and the link on the poster takes you to there webpage. The house in the poster was modeled after the big white house, which is one of the locations you viste on the tour.</p>

					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<img class=" aurora img-fluid" src="images/aurora.png" alt="digitaly drawn snowy mountains with northern lights in a night sky with words along the landscape." height="1244" width="812" >
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h2>Event Poster</h2>
			<p> The image on the right is an event poster, for a hike and history tour. This event does not exist. I have never seen the northern lights in person and imagened a fun event that would allow me to see them. The lights were made with a brush stroke I oulined. I applied a gradient to it then made a copy and did a step blend between them.</p>

			<h2>Introduction to computer graphics - Part 1</h2>
			<p>The class was instructed to choose one of the seven software tools covered in the previous weeks to create a digital piece of art that is distinctly different from an inspirational image found online.<br>I wanted to create a wallpaper to use on my PC that makes me happy. By cropping out and shifting the colors of images, I placed a few special animals from my life that have passed away or moved on to different families in a mystical forest to hang out with each other.</p>

			<h2>Part 2</h2>
			<p> We were instructed to choose a different software than part one and by following an online tutorial make a simple portfolio project.<br> I choose to work with Blender. Using a Blender Guru tutorial I made a neon sign diplaying my name. The majority of work was manipulating the vertices on the letters to make them look proportional, and extruding portions of the letters to make them appear connected.
