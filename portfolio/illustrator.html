			<h1>Projects I Made In Illustrator</h1>
			<p>Below are my creative projects from my Adobe Illustrator college course. In the class I learned the software through the 16 lessons from the 2020 version of Adobe Illustrator,'classroom in a book'. I used the techniques from thoughs lesson to create coasters, halloween and event posters, and a business card.</p>
			
			<h2>Coasters</h2>
			<p>In the left image is my coaster design the first project for the class. I did the four seasons from the perspective of my grandmas and her home. I am always at peace when visting her and love doing so during different times of the year.</p>
			<div class="container-fluid">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<img class="coaster img-fluid" src="images/coaster.png" alt="four circles with images inside representing the four seasons" height="613" width="762" >
					</div>

					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<img class="card img-fluid" src="images/business-card.jpg" alt="rectangular grid of ten sections in two columes with words and a ghostly girl image on a dark blue background" height="612" width="792" >
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
					<h2>Business Card</h2>
					<p> The business card logo was the final project for the class. I had the image of a long haired cat girl with her hair blowing in the wind over her face. It turned into a ghostly image, which I quite like. I made the image almost completly with the pen tool, using the ellipse tool to make the eyes and basic head shape.</p>
				
				<h2>Halloween project</h2>
				<p>For the halloween project we needed to make a poster for halloween or fall themed event. I made a poster for the ghost tour that is offerd in Anoka, Minnesoda. The ghost tour is a real event and the link on the poster takes you to there webpage. The house in the poster was modeled after the big white house, which is one of the locations you viste on the tour.</p>
			<div class="container-fluid">
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<img class="halloween img-fluid" src="images/halloween.png" alt="digitaly drawn image of a white mansion under a full moon night sky" height="1244" width="812" >
					</div>
					
					<div class="col-sm-6">
						<img class=" aurora img-fluid" src="images/aurora.png" alt="digitaly drawn snowy mountains with northern lights in a night sky with words along the landscape." height="1244" width="812" >
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h2>Event Poster</h2>
			<p> The image on the right is an event poster, for a hike and history tour. This event does not exist. I have never seen the northern lights in person and imagened a fun event that would allow me to see them. The lights were made with a brush stroke I oulined. I applied a gradient to it then made a copy and did a step blend between them.</p>
